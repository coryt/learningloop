## Modifying the code
First, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.

Test that Grunt's CLI is installed by running `grunt --version`.  If the command isn't found, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.  For more information about installing Grunt, see the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including Grunt).
1. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.

Assuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run `grunt` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
bower install
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed. If you don't have bower,
`npm install -g bower`.

The above steps will download all the required software to
build and run this app, such as [grunt](http://gruntjs.com),
[requirejs](http://requirejs.org), and [jquery](http://jquery.com).
