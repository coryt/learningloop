UI projects, i.e. API, MVC, should be stored in this folder. 

No business logic should exist in these projects. Keep things "skinny" and 
decoupled. To achieve these two goals, reference Core to access the business
entities and the interfaces you'll program against for services. 

The only reference projects in this folder should have is to Core and 
Dependency Resolution so that the IoC container may be initialized and 
dependencies get included in the UI.
